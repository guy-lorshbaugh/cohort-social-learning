COHORT DOO DOO TO-DOO

-  Menu listeners are still garbage. 

-  Comment like/reply

-  Reorganize stylesheet categories:
   ** Menus

-  Recent Emoji Menu - use a cookie? How do we do that??

FINITO

XX Entry Options needs to be restarted.
   ** Opening the emoji menu kills the entry option listener somehow. getID()
      throws a TypeError
   => The for loop read // for (item of entryOptions) //, but the 'let' declaration
      is neccesary for the value of 'item' to change.
XX Tragically, the expansive list of fabulous notes that had been compiled
   previously was lost in the labyrinthine hellscape that is Git. But much of 
   what was lost has been restored.
   ** And what's more, this file is no longer included in .gitignore!
