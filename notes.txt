COHORT DOO DOO TO-DOO

-  Emoji Search as a separate system than the emoji menu. They don't coexist
   well.

-  Comment like/reply

-  User Profiles

-  Menu listeners are still garbage. This is an issue that needs dealt with 
   systematically. A listener class could be useful if we can figure out how
   to make it work.

-  Reorganize stylesheet categories:
   ** Menus

-  Recent Emoji Menu - use a cookie? How do we do that??

XX Entry edit needs to redirect to the home page and flash "Your entry has been
   edited"

XX TO DO NOW: delete-option and edit-option need to be made entry-delete-option,
   comment-delete-option, etc

XX So we've kinda gone about entry editing all wrong. If users want to add or 
   remove tags, add resources to remember, or edit the title they can't. We need
   to invoke the form, probably insert the "edit.html" form into the comment 
   area rather than trying to use an editable DIV. This will help us deal with
   token issues as well.

XX Entry delete

XX Entry Options needs to be restarted.
   ** Opening the emoji menu kills the entry option listener somehow. getID()
      throws a TypeError
   => The for loop read // for (item of entryOptions) //, but the 'let' declaration
      is neccesary for the value of 'item' to change.
XX Tragically, the expansive list of fabulous notes that had been compiled
   previously was lost in the labyrinthine hellscape that is Git. But much of 
   what was lost has been restored.
   ** And what's more, this file is no longer included in .gitignore!

BINNED

XX => Edit entry system wasn't sufficient to edit the whole contents.
   Edit Entry returns only the FIRST text div. Need to add the nodes to a list
   and return that to setCaret.
   ** setCaret only works once. (THIS MIGHT BE FIXED, though I don't know how/if
      I actually did it.)
   ** div.esc-notice comes up multiple times if you cick "Edit Entry" more than
      once. Why user might do this I don't know but it's worth preventing 
      anyhow.
